\section{Diagnostic Programs for Monitoring the Proper Functioning of the Control System}

The \textbf{CNC 432} control is equipped with an efficient diagnostic system that provides high operational security during the programming procedure and while running programs.

The diagnostic system includes not only background diagnostic programs that continuously monitor the operation of the control system but also diagnostic programs that must be manually selected in \textbf{Diagnostic mode} to perform specific verifications or well-defined checks.

The diagnostic system is designed to determine the proper functioning of the following control system components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Power supply
    \item Microprocessor (central processing unit)
    \item Calculation unit
    \item Memory: \textbf{PROM} and \textbf{RAM}
    \item Plug-in "input-output" board (interface between the control system and the machine)
    \item Plug-in boards for adjustment devices (feed rate commands and main motor)
    \item Closed-loop position control systems
\end{itemize}

Errors and malfunctions are categorized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hardware errors
    \item Axis errors
    \item Spindle positioning errors
    \item Electronic handwheel errors
    \item Programming errors
    \item Memory errors
    \item Incorrect operations
    \item Data transmission errors
    \item Interface errors
\end{itemize}

Errors and malfunctions detected by the diagnostic system \textbf{without selecting} \textbf{Diagnostic mode} are displayed with the word \textbf{ERROR}, followed by an error code, on line 1 of the screen.

Error codes are grouped in a separate \textbf{error list}, located inside the control cabinet on the machine.

Errors and malfunctions detected by the diagnostic system \textbf{with selection} of \textbf{Diagnostic mode} are displayed on the visualization screen with the signal \textbf{DETECTED ERROR-NUMBER IS:}, followed by an error code.

The displayed error code must be reported to \textbf{MAHO customer service}.
